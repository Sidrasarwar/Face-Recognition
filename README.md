# Face Recognition System Using CNN and Haar Cascade
## Project Overview

This project is a face recognition system developed as a semester project for learning from data course. It employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Haar Cascade algorithms to detect and recognize faces from images and real-time video streams. The system can be used in various applications such as security systems, attendance monitoring, and user authentication.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers for accurate and fast face detection in images and video streams.
- **Face Recognition**: Employs a CNN model trained on a large dataset of faces to recognize individual faces with high accuracy.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Capable of processing live video feeds to detect and recognize faces in real-time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
## Installation
